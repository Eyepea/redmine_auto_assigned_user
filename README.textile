h2. How to use ?

# Go to the settings page: /settings/plugin/redmine_auto_assigned_user
# Define the project manager role. The first member of this role in your project will be used to assign the issue.
# Select the client roles. The plugin fills the *assign to* field if only the creator of the issue is member in the role list. With this parameter, the support team can create an issue without an assignation.
# In each project, assign a project manager and a client role.
